# REACT STACK NAVIGATION
#### Developer <br>
@jovemdeveloper
#### Methods
- push( page , params) <br>
  places the page in the navigation stack
- pushClean( page , params ) <br>
inserts the page into the navigation stack and clears the navigation stack, leaving only the page to be inserted

- replace( page , params) <br>
replaces the current page in the navigation stack

- goBack( )<br>
removes the current page from the navigation stack and returns to the previous one


#### How to use

```
import {StackNavigation} from "react-stack-navigation";
AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => StackNavigation(
    {
        Page1:Page1,
        Page2: Page2,
    },{
        initial: 'Page1'
    }
));
```
### Recommendation
 start the application with a splash, as all pages will have only one instance, that is, the constructor of each page will be executed only once and it takes time for all pages to be created in memory
